# Livepeer AI Example Scripts

This repository contains example scripts for using the Livepeer AI API. The scripts are written in bash and use the `curl` command to interact with the API.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script you want to use while being inside the `scripts` directory. For example, to run the `sam2_stacking_speed_test.bash` script, you can run the following command:

   ```bash
   ./sam2_stacking_speed_test.bash
   ```

3. If you don't want to use the public gateway at `https://dream-gateway.livepeer.cloud`, you can set the `AI_GATEWAY_URL` environment variable to your own API URL.
